### [Personal Website](./blog/1-building-this-website)
A personal website I created to learn about networking, web technologies, cloud services, infrastructure as code, and build automation. Inspired by the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/).

### [FFMPEG Frontend](https://github.com/huynhlkevin/ffmpeg-frontend)
An Electron app that I wrote to generate FFMPEG commands for video and audio processing tasks. Currently only supports video clipping.
