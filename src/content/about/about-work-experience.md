### [Extron](https://www.extron.com) -- May 2015 - present
I worked at Extron in product development, initially as an applications engineer and then as a systems programmer. My primary responsibilities included working on special projects, internal software, and programmed systems. My main achievements:
- Developed the [ControlScript Extension for VS Code](https://www.extron.com/product/software/controlscriptvscode) to deliver a streamlined Extron programming experience to customers.
- Developed an internal software stack for the product development and sales departments to create, update, and manage [Control System Drivers](https://www.extron.com/download/control-system-drivers).
- Developed an internal software application for product managers to generate Microsoft Word documents from [JAMA](https://rest.jamasoftware.com/) requirements.
