### [Extron](https://www.extron.com) -- May 2015 - present
I worked at Extron in product development, initially as an applications engineer and then as a systems programmer. My primary responsibilities included working on programmed systems, special projects, and internal software. Here are some of the things I have worked on:
- [ControlScript Extension for VS Code](https://www.extron.com/product/software/controlscriptvscode) - main developer (Typescript)
- [Extron Control for Logitech](https://www.extron.com/article/logitechcollab_1178pr) - prototype developer (C#)
- Internal software for developing [Control System Drivers](https://www.extron.com/download/control-system-drivers) - main developer (C#, Python, SQL)
