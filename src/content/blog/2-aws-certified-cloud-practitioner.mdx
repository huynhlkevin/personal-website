### Introduction
One of the challenges from the [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/) was to pass the [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/) exam. Here is the description of the exam:

> The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner validates foundational, high-level understanding of AWS Cloud, services, and terminology.  This is a good starting point on the AWS Certification journey for individuals with no prior IT or cloud experience switching to a cloud career or for line-of-business employees looking for foundational cloud literacy.

### Preparation
To learn the material, I watched [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification Course (CLF-C02) - Pass the Exam!](https://youtu.be/NhDYbskXRgc) by [Andrew Brown](https://x.com/andrewbrown) of [ExamPro](https://www.exampro.co/). To make watching a 14 hour course manageable, I watched about 1 hour a day. For review, I used practice exams from both ExamPro and [TutorialsDojo](https://tutorialsdojo.com/). In total, it took me about 3 weeks to prepare for the exam: 2 weeks to watch the course and 1 week to review with practice exams.

### Taking the Exam
There were two choices for taking the exam: at a test center or at home. I decided to take the exam at a test center so that I could just focus on the test and not the testing environment. I ended up using almost the entire 90 minutes for the exam so that I could double-check my answers.

### Reflection
If I had to take the exam again, I would spend more time studying the details of the [AWS Cloud Adoption Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud-adoption-framework/). Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the results of the exam, since I passed with a 881/1000. This exam also proved to me that studying over a longer period of time is much better than cramming for both retention and general comfort, so I'll keep this in mind when studying in the future.
